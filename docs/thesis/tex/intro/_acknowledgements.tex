\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I'd like to give thanks to the entire lecturing team at City College Plymouth for providing me with the skill-set required to have the opportunity to write this dissertation.

I'd also like to give a special thanks specifically to Tomasz Bergier for convincing me I am capable of doing a degree in the first place and giving me good guidance in the fields of statistics and high-performance computing. I'd also like to thank Andy and Anna for being superb mentors and great motivators in times of personal uncertainty.

Lastly, I'd like to give honourable mentions to Dr. Alma Rahat and David Walker at the University of Plymouth for their contributions to my work ethic and outlook on academia as a whole.
